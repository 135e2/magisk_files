## Magisk (ef9d077c) (20401)
- Better cleanup code for upgrading from super old Magisk version

## Magisk Manager (ef9d077c) (279)
- Logs now have their own section!
- Add back button when showing filtered modules
- Some internal code cleanups (Android navigation components)
- Please note: Magisk Manager hiding for Android 9.0+
(will be renamed to Manager Stealth mode in future updates)
in its current state is still a little bit whacky, but things
do work fine. Will try to smooth out the experience in the future!
